# odin-recipes
Odin Project foundations project

A quick recipe project where I've picked 3 recipes from All Recipes.

Tasks included in project:
 - Created a page for each of the recipes
 - Created an anchor tag for each of the recipes on the index page
  - Each page includes:
    - Title
    - Image
    - Description
    - Ingredients
    - Steps

Overall this project was pretty quick and reviewed a lot of existing knowledge for me. Not a bad start for the Odin Project.
